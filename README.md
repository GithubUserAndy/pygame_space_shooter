# pygame_space_shooter
This is a space shooter game based on the Pygame Space Invader tutorial by Tech with Tim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM (thank you Tim, plz check out Tim if you havent already)
I just uploaded this to showcase some cool changes I thought could be made to this project.
There are some features that I have not yet gotten round to adding such as a score and different laser animations.
If anyone sees this and is interested, please feel free to add your own stuff, id love to see what other ideas people have.
